      <div style="background-color: palegreen; padding-top: 0.1em; padding-bottom: 0.1em;"><h1 style="text-align: center; color:darkblue;"><em>Getting started with programming</em></h1></div><br><br>
      <h1 style="color:red; margin-left: 15px;">Why you should learn programming?</h1><br>
      <p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">If you are thinking about getting your computer programming degree, you will need to know about programming languages, classes, tasks and instructions. You will build various applications, software or programs. Additionally, you can create applications that need to work on various operating systems such as iOS or Android. Those programs have different functions and categories, which means they depend on different programming languages.

All applications on the web are run using a computer program. The language used in each application range from similar to very different. Also, some languages create backlash, so you don't even know they exist. Learning computer programming languages allows you to become a master of a wide variety of computer programs.</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">Behind everything we see on the internet—every word, image, chart, layout, etc.. there is someone who programmed it to look as such to us. Even the website you are looking now is programmed by someone. Here’s are some reasons why to learn programming.</p><br>
 <img src = "C:/Users/Dell/OneDrive/Desktop/project/bootstrap-5.1.0-examples/carousel/images/why-prog.jpg" 
        type = "image/x-icon" style="height:400px; width:90%;" class="center"></img><br><br>
        <p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">1. Programming ensures a good career opportunities</p>
        <p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">We live in an age of technology, and technological advancement is nowhere near staggering. As the use of technology devices grows every year, there will always be a great need for the system. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said that over the next decade, computer programming jobs would be more widely available to those outside the United States. This is because companies are considering hiring people around the world because they will pay them lower wages.

However, projects such as software development, web development, computer program analysts, and others reflect a positive work ethic over the next decade. Their average growth is from 9% to 21% in software development activities.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">2. Helps to develop problem solving and technical skills and makes you creative</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">In the real world, it is frequently said that writing code is all about to find the solution of problem that we arise, and programming be obliged to solving issues arises for us. Learning programs have in-general codes and determine how to address the issues that arise during coding and to find solutions to them. When you try to solve these problems, it becomes more and more helpful. You can also start using this mindset to solve problems in various aspects of your professional life and not just when entering codes.<br>Not all industries will give you the opportunity to use your technical and creative skills as programs will. This may be due to the nature of the activity. It focuses on identifying problems and solving them. However, there will not always be the same problems that need to be solved, which is why you will always find solutions when you find new solutions. This makes planning a very difficult and exciting task.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">3. Opportunities to get a job with consistency and flexibility in the workplace</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">As an IT professional, you will be working closely with software developers and web developers. Good communication and efficiency, understanding the process will help you do your job better. Although you may not use daily planning skills, having a background in this important area of technology can make you valuable to your company's IT department.
Since work requires only a computer with an internet connection, employees often have the opportunity to work remotely. That being said, that depends on company policy, but many offer such an option. In addition, if you work as a freelancer, your work will always be done remotely.

This benefit makes the program a much-needed activity for people who want to balance their work and family life and feel like traveling by wasting their precious time they could have used it differently. It also allows them to apply for jobs across the country without the need to relocate and worry about office space.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">4. Understand working of software</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">When we use a computer, we interact with it using a mouse and keyboard, but we do not stop and think about the operating system in the background. Editing will familiarize you with software, programs, devices, and websites and will help you understand them. As a result, you will be able to capture and use new technological tools as quickly as possible.</p><br>

        type = "image/x-icon" style="height:350px; width:75%;" class="center"></img><br><br>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">5. Ability to Earn Higher Income</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">Money can be a catalyst for a lot of work and a planning fee is no different. Most of the jobs you can get with planning skills tend to cost more than you normally would. While the salary for the programmer depends on the state and the type of work, the average salary for a computer program is $ 84,280, and the average salary for a software developer is $ 103,620.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">6. Teaching Perseverance</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">Learning a computer program teaches you to see problems in the light of solutions. For all the problems you may face, you begin to think of ways to solve them. The fruitful results that come from thinking and solving problems will give you a good idea, and it will affect you so that you can deal with the problem no matter how difficult it is. You are determined to find a way to find a solution, in this way you become a person driven by a solution.
Computer programs, like any other software, give you the opportunity to put your ideas digitally such as creating an app. However, creating an app is not an easy task as it requires effort, time, and money. While in some cases, you could pay an engineer to implement your plans and ideas, since being a programmer yourself, you can save your money and make the app the way you want it to. Especially since, let's be honest, no one can use your exact idea of what you want it to be.</p>

<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px; margin-left: 15px;">7. Develops start-up mindset</p>
<p style="color: yellow; font-size: 20px; margin-left: 15px;">If starting your own business is something you are interested in, knowing the basics of programming and coding is essential. In general, it’s easier to start a company if you have this skill set. You’ll be able to execute ideas yourself without paying anyone, as well as understand the work that programmers do once you are in a position to hire them. Programming skills also let you fine-tune the technology that is used in your business and create online sales channel right away.

Becoming self-employed is the path that many programmers eventually choose. Knowing how to code allows you to look into opening a business of your own. This could be an online shop, having your own web designing company, building mobile applications, offering online coding courses and tutorials, and many more. The opportunities are endless. What makes it even better is that the demand for these kinds of businesses is also high.

Programming is a skill that comes with numerous benefits. Some of the advantages that come with knowing code are a guaranteed job, getting to create interesting applications, developing problem-solving skills, and sometimes even the opportunity to work from home.</p>
